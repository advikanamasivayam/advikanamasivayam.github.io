Over the summer, I worked on CAD and machine learning algorithms for hull optimization and a surface generation research project with Myles Wortham for the lab of Professor Faez Ahmed. In this process, I developed Python and Rhino pipelines for B-spline surface generation and CAD mesh repair with Git version control, improving geometric accuracy over traditional mesh-based methods. I also implemented ship-hull optimization using genetic algorithms (an evolutionary AI technique) to generate physically accurate hull models.
