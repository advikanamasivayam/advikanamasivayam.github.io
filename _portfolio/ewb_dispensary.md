As a part of the MIT Engineers Without Borders Health & Sanitation Team, I worked on the CAD model of the healthcare dispensary that we implemented in Mkutani, Tanzania, using Fusion 360. This project aimed to improve maternal care and overall patient care for the 4,800 people the Mkutani dispensary serves, by renovating the roof and adding in a new maternity ward.
