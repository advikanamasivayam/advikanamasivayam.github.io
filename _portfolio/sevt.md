I am currently leading the design and fabrication of the roll cage for the MIT Solar Electric Vehicle Team's new car, _Solstice_, to compete at the 2026 American Solar Challenge. We designed the system using Solidworks to CAD and run simulations for stress analysis using Ansys FEA. We run simulations to test various load cases to make sure they all do not resulting in yielding and maintain a high safety factor. I also am working on bolt calculations to ensure optimal placement of hardpoints to mount the roll cage to the chassis of the car, which is made up of composite panels which we layed up. We are starting to manufacture the rollcage and will be using TIG welding to do so in-house.
