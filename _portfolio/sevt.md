I am currently leading the design and fabrication of the roll cage for the MIT Solar Electric Vehicle Team's new car, _Solstice_, to compete at the 2026 American Solar Challenge, a 1,500 mile route across the US. 

Design: 
We used SolidWorks to CAD the roll cage and make sure it can be integrated with the rest of the car.
I have been running simulations for stress analysis using Ansys FEA to to test various load cases specified by the competition guidelines. This is to make sure the structure is strong enough and does not yield with a high safety factor. 
I also worked on bolt calculations to ensure optimal placement of hardpoints to mount the roll cage to the chassis of the car. The chassis is made of carbon fiber composite panels which we layed up ourselves. 

Manufacturing:
We are beginning the manufacturing process of the car and will be TIG-welding the roll cage starting in the winter.
